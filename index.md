## Welcome to my personal website!
I update here my math studying notes on various interesting topics. The majority of notes are for my weekly presentation of the directed reading program, and the rest of them are taken just for fun. Since typing details in latex is such a pain, the notes focus mainly on ideas and observations of the proofs. Hope you will enjoy reading them!
